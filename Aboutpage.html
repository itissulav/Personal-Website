        <p>Hello, I am Sulav Paudel. I am a designer, developer, teacher as well as student.  I’ve always found my happiness in crafting and its artful showcase. What started out as a obsession of making my room efficient and pleasing turned into my passion. But there was problem, the reality is limited, I could only do so much before I ran out of materials or space. That’s when I first started coding, a limitless canvas, with everything i want. Creating something out of my mind only happens in Harry Potter and in coding. Which is exactly where I found myself. But having said that I am still a beginner trying to learn and gain some experience in the real world.</p>
